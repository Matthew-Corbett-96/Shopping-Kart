# Shopping-Kart
__Amazon Like Shopping Kart Console Application__ _-By Matthew J. Corbett_

# Description 
The Shopping-Kart program was initiially designed to practice creating interacting classes in C++ to work together on a single program. The program then evolved into a game like application that lets you pretend to shop on an online store. The app runs on the terminal so it can be independant and portable since most machines have a terminal preinstalled. It also allows the program to be lightweight and fast.
